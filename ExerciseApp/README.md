This project has various functionality to it including:
1) lazy loading imaging

2) Referencing to various sections of the webpage: 
By clicking on the named links in the navigation bar you can be directed to different sections on the webpage using the smooth scrolling feature

3) Revealing elements on scroll:
As you scroll down the page some sections will suddenly appear which makes it easier to get to sections without excess scrolling

4) The sticky navigation:
At a certain point on the webpage the navigation bar that was on top of the webpage will suddenly appear and will remain fixed on top of the webpage, it doesn't matter how far down the webpage you scroll, it'll then disappear once you scroll at a certain point

5) Tabbing:
If you click on the features of the navigation bar (top) you can click on each tab to find what the bank has to offer its clients

6) Navigating through testimonials:
Once again on the top navigation bar if you click on the testimonials it'll direct you to the testimonies of various clients, you can either click to a specific testimony or use the left/right buttons to page through each testimony individually

7) Footer reference links:
Right at the bottom lies the footer links, all links are inactive except "Back to top" which once clicked will take you back to the top of the webpage

8) The open account buttons:
Within the top navigation bar as well as in the footer section lies the open account button, clicking this will bring up a modal window which will enable you to open a new account with the bank, inputting information and submission on this page won't do anything though, it's there just to show the modal window. Clicking on the "x", the "next" button or on the webpage itself will close the modal window
